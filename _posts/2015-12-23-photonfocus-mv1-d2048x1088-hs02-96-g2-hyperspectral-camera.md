The Photonfocus MV1-D2048x1088-HS02-G2 camera deploys the IMEC snapshot mosaic CMV2K-SSM5x5-NIR sensor which is based on the CMOSIS CMV2000 CMOS image sensor. The sensor has in the spectral region from 600nm to 975nm 25 pass bands in a 5 by 5 mosaic with a Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) of 16nm. The spatial resolution of the sensor is 409 x 217 pixels per spectral band.

The cameras focus on demanding hyperspectral imaging applications. The low full well capacity and the global shutter of the sensor make high speed applications possible. The camera has the GigE interface (GigEVision).
